# Architecture

This repository is grounded in my experience as an IT Architect working across strategy, delivery, and governance. It curates reusable artefacts, templates, and visual frameworks that support storytelling, decision-making, and the operationalisation of architecture practices in modern digital workplaces.

This repository curates reusable artefacts, templates, and visual frameworks for IT architecture. It supports:

- **Storytelling** through layered diagrams and benefit maps  
- **Decision-making** with one-page summaries and Copilot-ready artefacts  
- **Operationalisation** of architecture practices in modern digital workplaces  

The resources are designed to help architects communicate clearly, align with business value, and embed architecture into delivery and governance workflows.
