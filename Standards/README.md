# Architecture Standards

This directory contains authoritative standards for integrating, designing, and governing technology solutions within enterprise architecture.

Each standard is maintained in its own subfolder, with supporting documentation and alignment to architectural principles.

## Structure

- Each standard has its own folder (e.g., `api-standard`, `data-governance`).
- The main document for each standard is a `README.md` within its folder.
- Supporting files (diagrams, mappings, examples) are stored alongside the standard as needed.

## Available Standards

- [Vendor Supplied APIs](./Standards/Vendor%20API/README.md): Minimum expectations and principles for integrating vendor-supplied APIs.

*I will add or update this list as new standards are published.*
