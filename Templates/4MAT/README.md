# 4MAT - Describe the Business Need or Opportunity

This is a concise framework for completing a one-page document, designed to articulate a business need or opportunity and secure approval to proceed with design or implementation. 
This framework is inspired by the original **4MAT teaching model** developed by **Dr. Bernice McCarthy**.  

Visit the official site: [About Learning – 4MAT](https://www.aboutlearning.com/) for more information about the 4MAT teaching model.

## 🎯 Purpose

The 4MAT document is used at the outset of the design process to:
- Clearly communicate the rationale, concept, approach, value, and impact of a proposed initiative.
- Support milestone decision points with structured, high-level summaries.
- Enable consistent, brief documentation that fits on a single page.

## 🧩 Structure

The guidance is based on the **4MAT teaching model** which organizes thinking and communication around four key questions:
- **🎯 Why** – What is the rationale or need?
- **💡 What** – What is the proposed solution?
- **🛠️ How** – How will it be delivered?
- **📈 What if** – What are the implications or outcomes?

This adaptation includes a fifth section:
- **💰 How Much** – What is the expected cost, effort, or value?

Each section includes purpose, guidance, and prompts to help authors or AI generate clear, concise content.

## 🚀 Usage

You can use the guidance to:
- Draft new 4MAT documents for business cases, design proposals, or governance submissions.
- Embed the structure into templates or automation tools.
- Support consistent communication across teams and stakeholders.
- Obtain approval for items representing milestone decision points in the design process.
