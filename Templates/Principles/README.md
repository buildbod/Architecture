# Architecture Principles

Architectural principles can guide consistent, scalable, and secure solution design across the enterprise. Principles can be split into two categories:

- **Core Architecture Principles** – applicable across all technology domains.
- **AI Architecture Principles** – tailored to the unique challenges and opportunities of AI systems.

> These principles are drawn from **real-world application** and illustrate how architectural thinking is used to guide decisions, shape solutions, and embed governance in practice.
> Every organisation is slightly unique — so it's important to **evaluate which principles best fit your context** and adapt them accordingly.

## Why Principles Matter

Architectural principles are not rules to restrict innovation — they are **guardrails that enable speed, safety, and alignment**. Whether reviewing a product, renewing a contract, or shaping a new solution, principles help us:

- Move fast without losing strategic alignment.
- Make consistent decisions across teams and projects.
- Embed governance that supports rather than hinders progress.

When the map isn’t clear, principles act as our compass.

## 📘 Core Architecture Principles

These principles apply across all enterprise IT services and include:

- **Primacy of Principles**
- **Maximise Benefits to Mott MacDonald**
- **Design for Resilience**
- **Comply with Regulations**
- **Enterprise Data as an Asset**
- **Ease-of-Use**
- **Requirements-Based Change**
- **Control Technical Diversity**
- **Design for Interoperability**
- **Tier 1 Cloud SaaS First**

## 🤖 AI Architecture Principles
These principles extend the core principles to address AI-specific concerns such as modularity, traceability, and responsible governance:

- **Modular and Composable Design**
- **Lifecycle Traceability**
- **Secure-by-Design**
- **Interoperability and Standards Alignment**
- **Scalable Infrastructure**
- **Model Portability and Reusability**
- **Observability and Monitoring**
- **Service Landing and Operational Readiness**
- **Governance Hooks**
- **Strategic Alignment with Organisational Vision**

## 🔗 Linkages to Good Practice Frameworks

These principles are informed by and aligned with established architecture and delivery frameworks:

- **TOGAF**: Principles are foundational in TOGAF’s ADM cycle, especially in the Preliminary Phase. Items like *Primacy of Principles*, *Design for Resilience*, and *Control Technical Diversity* reflect TOGAF’s emphasis on governance and consistency.
- **SAFe**: Principles such as *Requirements-Based Change*, *Ease-of-Use*, and *Tier 1 Cloud SaaS First* align with SAFe’s Lean Governance and Architectural Runway concepts. Governance is seen as an enabler of agility.
- **LeanIX**: Principles can be embedded as metadata or decision criteria within LeanIX Fact Sheets and Solution Building Blocks, supporting lifecycle management, strategic alignment, and compliance.

These linkages ensure that the principles are not only internally coherent but also externally validated against industry best practices.

## Governance as Enablement

Governance is embedded throughout these principles — not to slow us down, but to ensure:

- **Safe experimentation**
- **Policy alignment**
- **Auditability and accountability**
- **Sustainable and inclusive outcomes**


However, for architectural principles to truly guide decision-making, they must be **linked to business governance**. This linkage gives the principles **authority** — ensuring they are not just technical ideals but embedded in how the organisation operates, makes decisions, and manages risk.

In establishing this linkage, you may uncover **gaps in business governance** — areas where policy, process, or oversight is missing or unclear. These gaps are illustrated in the accompanying PDF documents and should be addressed to ensure governance is not just present, but effective.

Principles are applied consistently across architecture reviews, procurement decisions, and solution design. They help us build with confidence, knowing we’re aligned with organisational goals and regulatory requirements.
