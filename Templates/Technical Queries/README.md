# Technical Queries (TQ)

## Definition

A **Technical Query (TQ)** is a formal request for clarification, additional information, or resolution of a design or implementation issue that cannot be addressed informally. TQs can arise at any point in the lifecycle.

## Purpose

- Ensure timely resolution of technical uncertainties
- Maintain traceability of decisions
- Reduce risk of misalignment or late-stage rework

## Process

1. **Raise a TQ**
   - Any stakeholder (architect, supplier, delivery team) can raise a TQ.
   - Use a standard template: *Issue, Impact, Proposed Resolution, Required by Date*.
2. **Log and Track**
   - Record in a shared repository (e.g., project SharePoint or Jira).
   - Assign an owner (usually Solution Architect or Enterprise Architect).
3. **Review and Respond**
   - Architects provide guidance or escalate to Architecture Board if needed.
4. **Close and Archive**
   - Document resolution and link to relevant artefacts (e.g., HLD, LLD).

> TQs should be routinely reviewed (e.g., during weekly design stand-ups) and escalated if unresolved.

## Linkage to Known Practices
### TOGAF

- Technical queries typically fall under **Architecture Governance** and **Implementation Governance** phases.
- Addressed through **Architecture Board reviews, Design Assurance checkpoints**, and **Change Control processes**.
- Formal escalation paths exist for unresolved technical issues.

### SAFe

- Technical queries are handled during **PI Planning**, **System Demos**, and **Architecture Syncs**.
- Architects use **Enabler Epics** and **Architecture Runway** to resolve technical dependencies.
- Queries often feed into backlog items for resolution.

### Enterprise Practices

- Technical queries are logged in **Design Decision Registers** or **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**.
- They trigger governance touchpoints like **Solution Review Boards** or **Technical Design Authorities**.
