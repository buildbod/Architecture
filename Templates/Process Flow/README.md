# Architecture Artefact Flow

## ðŸ”„ Process Context

The diagram below illustrates how key architectural artefacts relate to each other:

- **Architectural Principles** underpin every stage, ensuring consistency and alignment.
- **Options Papers** can emerge from a business need or trigger a reassessment of the need, creating a feedback loop.
- Artefacts evolve iteratively; governance ensures alignment at each stage.

### âœ… Key

- **Blue** for Business Need & Architectural Statement.
- **Purple** for HLD and LLD.
- **Orange** for Implementation & Operations.
- **Grey** for Architectural Principles.
- **Dashed arrows** for Options Papers feedback loop.

## ðŸ”— Linkages to Frameworks

This artefact flow aligns with established frameworks:

- **TOGAF**  
  - *Business Need / Opportunity* â†’ **Architecture Vision**  
  - *HLD / LLD* â†’ **Architecture Definition & Design Phases**  
  - *Options Papers* â†’ **Trade-off Analysis**  
  - *Principles underpinning all stages* â†’ **Preliminary Phase**  

- **SAFe**  
  - Feedback loop reflects **Continuous Exploration**.  
  - HLD and LLD stages align with **Architectural Runway**.  
  - Governance note mirrors **Lean Governance** principles.  

- **LeanIX**  
  - Artefacts can map to **Fact Sheets** and **Solution Building Blocks**.  
  - Principles can be embedded as **governance metadata** for lifecycle management.
