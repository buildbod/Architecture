# ðŸ“˜ Solution Building Block (SBB) Style Guide

This example style guide outlines the use of **Solution Building Blocks (SBBs)** in architecture views created with draw.io.

It is based on:

- [TOGAF Building Block Characteristics](https://www.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf7-doc/arch/p4/bbs/bbs_intro.htm)
- [LEANIX Meta Model](https://help.sap.com/docs/leanix/ea/meta-model?locale=en-US)

The guide defines how to represent and relate key architectural elements, including:

- **Business Applications** â€“ Software systems supporting business tasks
- **IT Components** â€“ Technologies enabling business applications
- **Interfaces** â€“ Logical connections for data flow
- **Data** â€“ Abstract representations of datasets and attributes
- **General Entities** â€“ Locations, processes, or organizational units
- **Connectors** â€“ Associations and Dataflows between SBBs
- **Supporting Text** â€“ Contextual annotations
- **Solution Users** â€“ Roles interacting with the architecture
