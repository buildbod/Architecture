# Architectural View Guidance

This guide explains how to create architectural views that communicate solutions effectively using layered diagrams. Views are storytelling tools, not blueprints. The goal is clarity — enabling stakeholders to understand the **why** and **how** without getting lost in technical detail.

## 🎯 Purpose
- Communicate architecture at the right level for the audience.
- Support decision-making and design alignment.
- Provide context for technical and business stakeholders.

## 🧩 View Levels
### 🗺️ Outline-Level
- Focus: Business applications, interfaces, data, general context.
- Audience: Business and senior stakeholders.

### 🏢 High-Level
- Focus: IT components (types), associations, dataflows.
- Audience: IT leadership, project managers, analysts.

### 🔍 Low-Level
- Focus: Named IT assets, environments, configurations.
- Audience: Operational and development teams.

## 🔄 Business vs IT Views
- **Business View:** Outcomes, roles, processes. Minimal technical detail.
- **IT View:** Adds technical detail while staying anchored in business goals.

## 🪜 Creating Layered Views
1. Create a master (architect) view with all Solution Building Blocks (SBBs).
2. Apply connectors for associations and dataflows.
3. Add supporting text and solution users.
4. Assign elements to layers.
5. Export views using layer control (e.g., PDF for consumption).

## 💡 Tips
- Use layers to tailor views for different audiences.
- Keep diagrams simple and focused on the story.
- Combine levels if needed, but choose a “best fit” category.
