## ðŸ§  Background: Solution Building Blocks (SBB)

**Solution Building Blocks (SBB)** are based on the **Building Block characteristics described in TOGAF**. They are used to represent a wide variety of aspects of the architecture depending on the story being communicated.

The **type of SBB** is derived from the **LeanIX Meta Model**, which defines the relationships between each building block. This model supports consistent representation across:

- Data
- Business Applications
- IT Components
- Interfaces
- General entities (e.g., locations, processes)

Each icon in this library is designed to reflect these categories and support layered architecture views (e.g., business, technology, and outline levels).
